# The Arcade
Final project for Spring 2016 Class Newly Formed Led by Chris and Kathleen Sleboda. Each site is based off different sets of insipiration images we had to bring in for our class every week. In total, 10 websites were made.

## The ten websites were:
* Control
* Emergent
* Field
* Future
* Critique
* Interaction
* Internet
* Music
* Point
* Pysche
